# Rankup tasks generator
---
Short version about this app:
--
In our Minecraft project we have 3 servers, where we use system for players leveling up by completing some tasks. Since this system creation (I guess 5+ years) there are same rankup tasks each season. And players are bored because of that. My idea was to create app, that generates new tasks each season by my configuration. Final version of this app should generate yml file, which I can place to Minecraft plugin configuration folder without any editing by hand.
